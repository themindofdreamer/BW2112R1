   <!-- <textarea name="" id="" cols="40" rows="10"> <b><ins>Fox is a common name for many species of carnivorous mammals belonging to the Canidae family.</ins></b> Foxes are small to medium-sized canids (slightly smaller than the median-sized domestic dog), characterized by possessing a long narrow snout, and a bushy tail (or brush).
<b><ins>Members of about 37 species are referred to as foxes, of which only 12 species actually belong to the Vulpes genus of 'true foxes'.</ins></b> By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes), although various species are found on almost every continent. The presence of fox-like carnivores all over the globe has led to their appearance in both popular culture and folklore in many cultures around the world (see also Foxes in culture). </textarea> -->
